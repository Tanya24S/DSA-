//Note:
/* If elements are not changing and we require first max, second max or first smallest, second smallest etc then you can use sorting.
   Else if elments are dynamic and can be changed, then maybe use min heap/max heap according to requirement.*/

/*Whenever we want custon sorting like sorting pairs and pair is a class then we use comparators, you may either use your own sorting or comparators which won't take time
  How it works? It basically changes to if condition in sorting algorithm*/
