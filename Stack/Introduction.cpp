//How to Identify if it's a stack problem:
//1. It'll be an array question (usually for array question you apply either stack or heap but with heap you'll feel like sorting)
//2. If you have written brute force solution of O(n^2) where we have depended loop, where j(nested loop) value depends on i, here you can write a better solution using stack.
//First identify the pattern(from those you have studied) then if there can be any variation from it.
