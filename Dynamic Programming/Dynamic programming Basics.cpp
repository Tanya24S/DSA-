//DP parent problem recursion, wherever overlapping Recursion, we'll apply DP
//How to identify problem:
//1. Choice given in question to keep or eliminate the element
//2. To optimize in problem(either maximize or minimize)

//Approach: Recursive solution-> Memoization-> Top Down Dp
//1. Knapsack Problem(Bag)
// 3 types-> Fractional Knapsack(not part of DP, comes under greedy algorithm), 0/1 Knapsack, Unbounded Knapsack

//DP recurive code
