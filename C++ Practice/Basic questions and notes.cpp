//pass by value and pass by reference, 1)In pass by value, we just inherit the value and make a new copy of it, 2) In pass by reference we want og to get edited
//so we pass a reference to it as string& s (pass by value will not be the ebst for big data structures with large values, more memor consumption)
//C++in stl: If write const in front of the vector then it won't get updated, read only mode, use push_back() to add elements in the vector
//Size of Fundamental Data Types
sizeof()
